# zoom-chat-to-csv

A web tool that takes in a Zoom chat log and spits out a CSV file for easier analysis. This tool is an extended version of an internal one I developed to make tracking lecture attendance & participation easier for remote classes, since for some reason, Zoom does not provide this functionality by default.
